	<h1>Help</h1>
	
	<h2>Do I really need Twitter to sign in?</h2>
	
	<p>Yes.</p>
	
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	
	<p>Voodoo.</p>
	
	<h2>Can I really use any web page?</h2>
	
	<p>Yes. We can't promise that we'll be able to turn it in to a decent quality commentable document and we tend to do far better with pages which contain an article, but you can give us any page and we'll do our best.</p>
	
	<h2>What are the thumb up and thumb down links for?</h2>
	
	<p>These let you give either a positive or negative 'vibe' to a specific paragraph. If you like what it says, give it the thumbs up. If you don't, thumb it down.</p>
