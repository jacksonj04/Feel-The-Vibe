	<h3>What is a vibe?</h3>
	
	<p>A vibe is a simple 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' against a specific paragraph which you can use to express your approval or disapproval of what's being said.</p>
	
	<h3>How can I leave a vibe?</h3>
	
	<p>Make sure you're signed in, then hover over a paragraph. You'll see the thumb up and thumb down icons appear; just click the one you want. You'll see a red or green line appear down the right hand side of the paragraph (depending on which thumb you chose) and the appropriate thumb icon will become permanently visible.</p>
	
	<p>How do I see other people's vibes?</p>
	
	<p>We'll automatically display vibes by highlighting paragraphs in the appropriate colour and by showing a 'vibe total' next to them. You can toggle the display of vibes on or off using the option in the commenting box.</p>
